            Devotion to the game is what will set you apart from the rest. To become a professional footballer, you need to live and breathe the game. The journey won’t be all smooth sailing, but your passion will help you to power through the negative and challenging moments. If you want to be a professional athlete in today’s market, you need to be 100% committed. Every fibre of your being needs to be determined to make it; without this, you’ll fall behind the competition.

          <p>
            While this may seem obvious, you’d be surprised how often this point is pushed aside. To make it as a footballer, training once a week just isn’t going to cut it. To be better than your competition, training regularly is essential. If your club offers training or summer camps, make use of those as well. Not only will you learn new skills, but you’ll feed off the competitiveness and enthusiasm of other players. Training camps are designed to teach you a lot of new skills in a short period of time. If possible, also get involved in organised games outside of your club. Try to get into tournaments that represent your school, region, or county at the youth level.

          <p>
            To become a professional footballer, learn from those that have already made it. Watch how footballers in the <a class="plain" href="https://www.premierleague.com/" style="text-decoration:underline orange" >Premier League</a> play and copy their moves and tactics. This may sound obvious, but you’d be amazed at how many players ignore this! For best results, choose a player who plays in your position and watch him closely. Pay attention to his positions when on and off the ball and follow suit.
